## Overview ##
World Cuisine is a user-friendly application which allows a user to create, update or read the recipes present in the application database. 
All the recipes are connected to the cuisines. The user will get the recipe details according to the cuisines they choose. Unfortunately because 
of some technical issues I don't have any screenshots of the application that I can present here.
